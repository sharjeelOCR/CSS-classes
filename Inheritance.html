    <p>Let’s take the next step and learn how to make your React components dynamic and reusable.

        Before we talk about how to do this in React, though, <b>let’s look</b> at how to do this with <i>plain JavaScript</i>. This might seem a bit basic but bear with me. Let’s say you have this function:</p>
        <div>hello this is aline in div not in paragraph. <a href="http://www.dfsdlkfl;.com">PIAIC</a></div>
        <div>hello this is aline in div not in paragraph in which we inherit the a tag as well <a href="http://www.dfsdlkfl;.com">PIAIC</a></div>
</body>
